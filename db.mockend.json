The Grand Egyptian Museum was slated to open this year after nearly two decades in the making, prompting Lonely Planet to name Cairo one of the top cities to visit in 2020. It’s easier than ever to travel around the country, with the recent introduction of e-visas, the opening of a new airport in Giza and new domestic flight routes between Sharm El Sheikh and Luxor, two of the country’s main tourist hubs.Egyptian government tries new tactics to lure tourists Mortuary temple of Queen Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri, Luxor, Egypt © Michelle McMahon/Getty Images But even as the coronavirus pandemic continues to stifle international travel, Egypt is trying new tactics to lure visitors to the country. In June, the government eliminated the need for tourist visas for visitors to the country’s ‘touristic governorates’ – South Sinai, Red Sea, Luxor and Aswan – and the country’s cabinet has just decided to extend the incentive until the end of April 2021 to encompass the winter season, which is usually when Egypt receives the highest number of visitors. Travelers who fly with EgyptAir or Air Cairo also get a 20% discount on tickets to museums and archaeological sites.The frontage of Coptic Museum in Cairo, Egypt. The frontage of the central entrance of Coptic Museum © efesenko / Getty Images The country reopened to tourists in July, and it’s yet to be seen whether these offers will entice more visitors. When arriving in Egypt, all passengers are required to present a negative PCR test certificate, with the test conducted no more than 72 hours before departure.Egypt had expected to receive some 15 million tourists in 2020, matching the number of visitors in 2010, a year before the Arab Spring revolutions brought turmoil and uncertainty to the region, but as with all other countries, the numbers will fall far below the target. Tourism is an important industry in the country and makes up more than 10% of Egypt’s economy.",

To support Egypt’s tourism sector amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Egypt’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, Ministry of International Cooperation, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the UN’s World Trade Organization (UNWTO) recently signed a COVID-19 tourism recovery technical assistance cooperation package to promote resilience, sustainability, and inclusive growth.",

This is due to the death of a South African tourist in January 2018 when a hot air balloon crashed; the incident also left many tourists injured and was attributed to poor weather conditions.Moreover, Egypt holds the record for the deadliest balloon accident in history. In 2013, a hot air balloon crash incident ensued when a balloon caught fire in mid-air. The tragic incident claimed the lives of 19 more tourists.Prior, crashes in Egypt are known to have occurred in 2008, 2009 and 2011.Giving tourists a unique view to cities with iconic buildings and landscapes, hot air balloons are popular in touristic countries such as Turkey, Kenya and the US among many others.In Egypt, they are also popular among archaeologists and Egyptologists who seek to capture an ‘overview’ angle of various archaeological sites. This is due to the fact that the use of drones—commonly used in the field of archaeology—by non-military personnel is illegal in Egypt."

You can see it all across the city. \n\n Egyptian national dress is a symbol of pride and identity that has been designed with the dual intent of providing comfort and adhering to religious beliefs. In Egypt, men wear an ankle-length, loose-fitting garment made of white cotton, known as a kandora or dishdasha. A ghutrah covers the head and is held in place by the agal, a type of black cord. This garment was originally used to protect the face from the harsh desert environment, \n\n Traditionally, women in Egypt wear an abaya – a long, flowing light coat over their clothing. This is worn over their Western clothes or a traditional long-sleeved full-length dress known as a jalabeya. A black scarf is often draped over the head. ",
